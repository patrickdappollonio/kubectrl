`@kubectrl` is a Twitter account that shares interesting and amazing Kubernetes tools, like:

* Plugins (for `krew`)
* Controllers:
  * Admission controllers
  * Generic controllers
  * ...
* Operators
  * With or without self-healing capabilities
* Desktop or Web tools to simplify Kubernetes operations

If your app fits any of these categories -- or perhaps another category, not listed here, but you think it'll be a good fit -- consider sharing it by opening a Pull Request!

## How do I tweet my tools to this Twitter account?

Quite simple, a detailed set of instructions is [here](tweets/README.md). However, the gist of it is:

* Create a new file under the `tweets/` folder.
* In the file content, write your tweet, include a link to your application.

For quality control, ensure at least:

* That the link you're sharing in the tweet takes users to either a blog post or the Github repository where your application is explained. Github links are preferred since links to specific pages can change later down the road and produce some _nasty_ results.
* That the usage instructions are clear, in English, and understandable for the average Kubernetes administrator.
* That there are no "hidden steps" to get to use your app.
* That it's "socially-acceptable".

Other than that, during the PR review of your Tweet we can discuss even further!
